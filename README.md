Additionally, it enhances user convenience by offering customization options for flight preferences, including class of service, meal selections, and luggage allowances. Users can also view their purchase history. However, the scope is limited to flights departing from Kuching, and there is only one flight per destination daily. Moreover, users cannot select seats, link to e-wallets or banks, or access check-in services. Festival discounts, promotions, ride and hotel booking services, as well as point collection and reward programs, are also not included.
